# Maximum-Product-Subarray

## Difficulty: Medium
Given an array arr[] that contains n integers (may be positive, negative or zero). Find the product of the maximum product subarray.

Note: It is guarenteed that the output fits in 64-bit integer.

Examples

Input: arr[] = {6, -3, -10, 0, 2}, n = 5
Output: 180
Explanation:  The subarray [6, -3, -10] gives max product as 180.
Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, -1, 0}, n = 6
Output: 120
Explanation: The subarray [2, 3, 4, 5] gives max product as 120.
Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 4}, n = 3
Output: 24
Explanation: For an array with all positive elements, the result is product of all elements.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
